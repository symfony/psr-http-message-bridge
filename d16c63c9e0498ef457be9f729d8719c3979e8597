I've fixed this issue a while ago for all supported versions of Symfony and PHP >= 5.6: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/9f9b0f73aafa1a70c87ec2eab87d5e60ce15bfda

Are you sure to use PHP >= 5.6 and a up to date version of Symfony?

Your change in Symfony is exactly causing the problem for all PHP version < 5.6.
The patch makes it working again with 5.4/5.5.

We do then at least need a test to prevent breaking this again in the future.

Done. Are you able to create a new release soon?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@dunglas Are you willing to merge the PR and create a new release?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dunglas at 2016-02-15T13:08:32Z

Yes but I need to review it first and it must be accepted by at least 2 members of the core team including me.

The code looks good to me :+1:

Ping @symfony/deciders

:+1: for the fix, but moving the assertion to a dedicated test imho would make it more clear what we want to ensure

@xabbuh @dunglas @symfony/deciders Done moving to own test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@dunglas @xabbuh Can you explicitly ask one of the other core developers to have a look? It's really important for us to get this merged. Thanks :-)

Both @dunglas and @xabbuh are part of the core team. You got two +1, so this is ready to be merged. ping @dunglas
