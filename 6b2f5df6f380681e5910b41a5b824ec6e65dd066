Thank you. I think, we're almost there. ðŸ™‚

Leveraging the new `getPayload()` method to populate the parsed body of the PSR-7 request is a good idea.

The test that you've added covers the happy case well. But what happens if the JSON payload cannot be decoded? We should also have a test that covers this case.

That's a good idea, I will add this test case tomorrow morning
